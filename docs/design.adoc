== High-level flow

The main workspace controller progresses through a number of steps; each reconcile loop currently starts from the beginning, as a change to e.g. a component could mean changes to all following stes.

image::high_level_flow.png[Flow diagram]

Each step in the main workspace controller reconcile is represented by a file in `pkg/controller/workspace/provision`.

===  Key structs

|===
| Name | Fields | Notes
| `PodAdditions`
| Containers, init containers, volumes, labels, and annotations that are to be added to the main workspace deployment
| Used to pass data from subcontrollers to main workspace controller

| `ComponentAddition`
| Encapsulate all information we support from each component. Has fields for podAdditions and additional devfile-specific information (e.g. devfile attributes, runtime commands, etc.)
| Additional metadata from devfile is required for various further processing (e.g. whether an endpoint is public, which commands match with which container, etc.)

| `ProvisioningStatus`
| Boolean flags to signal different states for a reconcile and communicate errors; used in `pkg/controller/workspace/provision`
| Intended to be embedded in step-specific struct that provides additional context: e.g. For components, we embed a `ProvisioningStatus` in a struct that also provides PodAdditions. This provides a uniform process for checking whether there is an error or if we can continue reconciling in the main reconcile loop.

|===


===  Subcontrollers
Each controller is responsible for a distinct subset of resources:

|===
| Controller | Responsibliity
| Main controller 
| Reconciles subcontrollers, workspace prerequisites, service account, and deployment

| WorkspaceRouting subcontroller
| Reconciles ingresses, routes, and services for workspace

| Component subcontroller
| Responsible for maintaining status to reflect current components

|===

Subcontrollers pass data back to the main controller via their status:

|===
| Subcontroller | Relevant status struct
| Component
| `ComponentDescriptions` - see above

| WorkspaceRouting
| - `PodAdditions` (see above) -- used to e.g. add an OpenShift oauth-proxy container to the deployment.

- `ExposedEndpoints`: map of exposed URLs and the devfile attributes associated with them

|===

== Differences from current che-workspace-operator

* All controllers do full reconciling of all objects they are responsible for; this means deleting a route or the workspace deployment means it will be recreated
** The main workspace controller now watches all resources it creates to trigger reconciles
* The main reconcile loop is split into phases with subcontrollers; it only progresses based on status of earlier steps (i.e. if components aren't ready, we don't try to create routing)
* All service/ingress/route creation is delegated to WorkspaceRouting
* The openshift-oauth routingClass results in the openshift oauth-proxy container running in the main workspace deployment
* There's a cleaner separation between elements in `pkg/controller` -- no imports across controllers (i.e. WorkspaceRouting imports nothing from Workspace)
** All shared structs are extracted to `apis` folder

== Outstanding issues / TODOs
* Not much is done to limit unnecessary reconciles; while reconciling works as intended, we likely run through the reconcile loop unnecessarily
* Better handling of errors is needed in the future; occasionally conflicts are logged on update due to stale resources
* Che-rest-apis configuration should be handled via a configmap, instead of relying on the rest-apis container to read required information from workspace status; this would also clean up workspace statuses
** We can likely also move the devfile into a configmap and read that as a file instead of from the spec
* Better handling of persistent storage, ephemeral workspaces, etc. Also need to support individual ephemeral volumes in an otherwise persistent workspace
* Clean up persistent storage on workspace removal, as one PVC is shared between workspaces in a namespace

== Open questions
. How should mountSources be handled? 
.. VolumeMounts *and* Volumes are defined in adaptors (i.e. dockerfile adaptor includes `/projects` in its status)
*** Means we have to deduplicate volumes when merging for main deployment, since multiple components could contribute it
*** Have to sync with controller's settings to get PVC name, etc.
.. VolumeMount defined in adaptor, Volume defined in main controller
*** Have to sync between controllers, as half of the mount is defined in workspace controller and other half in component controller (e.g. volume and mount name have to match)
*** Outputs of component controller is not "complete" -- workspace controller has to remember to add
.. VolumeMounts *and* Volumes are defined in workspace controller
*** Config is synced, and no need to de-dupe volumemounts
*** MountSources state is lost by default; have to pass back in ComponentMetadata, etc.
    **** Complicates matching containers in podadditions to component
*** Hard to match which plugin containers get sources and which don't

+
*Solution*: option *b* for now, to match main repo's approach

. "Discoverable" endpoints
** Che docs:
+
> discoverable: If an endpoint is discoverable, it means that it can be accessed using its name as the hostname within the workspace containers (in the Kubernetes parlance, a service is created for it with the provided name).

** Attribute is intended to allow integration with existing infrastructure (e.g. defining a service that can be used by a non-workspace component)
** Do we need to continue to support this option?

. How should containers in a workspace be named? Should we use workspace or container name where available? What does this affect?
